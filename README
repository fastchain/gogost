GOST is GOvernment STandard of Russian Federation (and Soviet Union).

* GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830) block cipher with ECB, CNT (CTR), CFB, MAC
  CBC (RFC 4357) modes of operation
* various 28147-89-related S-boxes included
* GOST R 34.11-94 hash function (RFC 5831)
* GOST R 34.11-2012 Стрибог (Streebog) hash function (RFC 6986)
* GOST R 34.10-2001 (RFC 5832) public key signature function
* GOST R 34.10-2012 (RFC 7091) public key signature function
* various 34.10 curve parameters included
* GOST R 34.12-2015 128-bit block cipher Кузнечик (Kuznechik) (RFC 7801)
* GOST R 34.13-2015 padding methods

Known problems:
